**Movie Recommendation System**
This project is a content-based movie recommendation system developed as part of a Python internship with YBI Foundation. The system suggests similar movies based on genres and descriptions using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

📋 Objective
To build a recommendation system that helps users discover movies similar to their preferences by analyzing movie content features such as genres and descriptions.

📂 Dataset
A small sample dataset containing:
- Movie Titles: Names of popular movies.
- Genres: Categories describing the movie's theme.
- Descriptions: Brief summaries of the movies.

🛠️ Features
- Content-Based Filtering: Combines genres and descriptions for calculating similarities.
- Text Processing: Uses `CountVectorizer` to convert text data into feature vectors.
- Similarity Calculation: Computes cosine similarity to find and rank similar movies.

🚀 Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing: Combines and transforms data for analysis.
2. Feature Extraction: Converts text data into numerical vectors using NLP.
3. Similarity Computation: Applies cosine similarity to identify similar movies.
4. Recommendations: Returns the top 5 similar movies based on a given movie title.

📈 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas for data manipulation.  
- Scikit-learn for text vectorization and similarity computation.  

📊 Output Example
Input: "The Matrix"  
Recommended Movies:
- Inception  
- Interstellar  
- The Dark Knight  
- Pulp Fiction
